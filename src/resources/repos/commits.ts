   * **Signature verification object**
   *
   * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of
   * verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the
   * `verification` object:
   *
   * | Name        | Type      | Description                                                                                      |
   * | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   * | `verified`  | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified.                  |
   * | `reason`    | `string`  | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
   * | `signature` | `string`  | The signature that was extracted from the commit.                                                |
   * | `payload`   | `string`  | The value that was signed.                                                                       |
   *
   * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Value                    | Description                                                                                                                       |
   * | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   * | `expired_key`            | The key that made the signature is expired.                                                                                       |
   * | `not_signing_key`        | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature.                                           |
   * | `gpgverify_error`        | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service.                                                         |
   * | `gpgverify_unavailable`  | The signature verification service is currently unavailable.                                                                      |
   * | `unsigned`               | The object does not include a signature.                                                                                          |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit.                                                                                      |
   * | `no_user`                | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit.                                                          |
   * | `unverified_email`       | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
   * | `bad_email`              | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature.             |
   * | `unknown_key`            | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account.                                                  |
   * | `malformed_signature`    | There was an error parsing the signature.                                                                                         |
   * | `invalid`                | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature.                      |
   * | `valid`                  | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified.                                                  |
